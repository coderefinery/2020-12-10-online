### Course goals and format

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for version control in modern research software development. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to use programming well.

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along type
of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate
with practical exercises.

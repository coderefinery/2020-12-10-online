### Preparation

You need to **install some software** before the workshop
([why we ask you to do this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).

You also need to **check your Git configuration**
([video: how to configure Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg)).
If you have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some **configuration**
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)

Please **read the first episode of our course**: [Motivation for version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/01-motivation/) (10 min read).

Please try to **make a first commit before the course starts** (20 min, ["Tracking a guacamole
recipe with
Git"](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/02-basics/#type-along-tracking-a-guacamole-recipe-with-git)
up to right before "Exercise: record changes").
